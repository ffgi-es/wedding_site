        <h2>We moved in together</h2>
        <p>
            After knowing each other for 4-5 months, Alastair needed somewhere
            to stay as he had to leave the room he was living in.

            Luckily Emilie trusted him enough it seems to let him move into her
            flat in Poble Sec.
